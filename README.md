# triangleTools
One-loop, three-point topologies appear all over the place in hadron physics. Sometimes it is necessary investigate the kinematic structure of these graphs beyond what is available by established tools (e.g. LoopTools), such deriving the discontinuity across a cut. 

This repository is a set of tools to facilitate checking such derivations by evaluating triangles using different methods.
